                                Keto diet is basically prescribed for the epilepsy affected children. This diet helps to force the body to burn fats rather than the usual carbohydrates. Generally, the food which consists of carbohydrates are converted into glucose and then it gets transported throughout the body which ultimately fuel the brain function. Perhaps if there are few carbohydrates left in the diet the organ liver converts fat into fatty acids and ketone bodies. The next process will be the replacement of glucose as an energy source. Thus, the upliftment of ketone bodies in the blood, a state known as ketosis, leads to the reduction in the frequency of epileptic seizures.

                                               The ketogenic diet induces ketosis, a measurable state of metabolism that can be a great approach to losing weight through fat burning. Because it involves our metabolism, our results will be unique to us, whether or not it’s a faster or slower weight loss. The ketogenic diet is a regimen used to treat and manage disease and promote overall health– weight loss is just a bonus. But the healthiness of implementing keto still depends on how it is implemented.
